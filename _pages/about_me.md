I've been building robots since I was 13 years old. Over the years as I've transitioned from Mindstorms to ROS I enjoyed every step of the way.

Before [Berkshire Grey](https://www.berkshiregrey.com), I worked at two start-ups in the self-driving vehicles industry: [Aerovect](https://aerovect.com/#/home) and [Nuro](https://www.nuro.ai/). At AeroVect I designed and built the detection and tracking systems for vehicles and pedestrians at airports. At Nuro, I led the work on [siren detection and localization](https://medium.com/nuro/safety-nuro-our-vehicles-f3c33d605614#:~:text=Emergency%20vehicle%20microphone,safely%20pull%20over.) for emergency vehicles. Prior to that, I built localization, [mapping](https://communitech.ca/technews/clearpath-maps-a-new-way-forward.html) and calibration software at Clearpath Robotics, pre Rockwell acquisition.

You can view an updated copy of my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rEeNh2QY2G2TiRXiHhyz_2sWhtJeEV-m/view?usp=sharing).

While working full-time, I completed a computer science masters degree from Georgia Tech, specializing
in Machine learning. My undergraduate degree is in Mechatronics Engineering from the University of Waterloo
where I interned at Nest Labs(Google Hardware), Waymo and worked under [Prof. Sebastian Fischmeister](https://uwaterloo.ca/embedded-software-group/people-profiles/sebastian-fischmeister) on a [demonstrator for ADAS software](https://uwaterloo.ca/embedded-software-group/projects/adas-treadmill-demonstrator#:~:text=The%20ADAS%20platform%20consists%20of,treadmill%20without%20it%20drifting%20away.).

On an unrelated note, I'm currently building an audio guestbook product called [RingRing](https://ringringphone.ca/). I'm working with a close friend of mine on this project and we used it at both of our weddings! We wanted to capture messages from our loved ones in a special way. If you're getting married or throwing a party sometime soon, signup to be notified when we launch.
