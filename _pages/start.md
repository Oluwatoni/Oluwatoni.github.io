Hi! I'm Toni, short for [Oluwatoni](https://youtu.be/roa7i_KPFdY?t=5). I design and build software for robotic systems that solve customer problems. I focus primarily on robotic perception but I've worked on localization, mapping and controls in the past. I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer
at [Berkshire Grey](https://www.berkshiregrey.com/) working on perception problems in the logistics and retail space.

Previously, I worked at two start-ups in the self-driving vehicles industry: [Aerovect](https://aerovect.com/#/home) and [Nuro](https://www.nuro.ai/). At AeroVect I designed and built the detection and tracking systems for vehicles and pedestrians at airports. At Nuro, I led the work on [siren detection and localization](https://medium.com/nuro/safety-nuro-our-vehicles-f3c33d605614#:~:text=Emergency%20vehicle%20microphone,safely%20pull%20over.) for emergency vehicles. Before that, I was in the industrial automation space building localization, [mapping](https://communitech.ca/technews/clearpath-maps-a-new-way-forward.html) and calibration software at Clearpath Robotics, pre-acquisition.

While working full-time, I completed a computer science masters degree from Georgia Tech specializing
in Machine learning. My undergraduate degree is in Mechatronics Engineering from the University of Waterloo
where I interned at Google, Waymo and worked under [Prof. Sebastian Fischmeister](https://uwaterloo.ca/embedded-software-group/people-profiles/sebastian-fischmeister) on a [demonstrator for ADAS software](https://uwaterloo.ca/embedded-software-group/projects/adas-treadmill-demonstrator#:~:text=The%20ADAS%20platform%20consists%20of,treadmill%20without%20it%20drifting%20away.).

In my spare time I [blog](/blog/) about what I'm learning and building. Currently I'm building an audio guestbook with my friend Seyitan called RingRing.

If you're a student or someone early in their robotics career and you'd like a resume review, a code review or career advice reach out using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfjO_PzATLdNbKujqF6jU-rk7kgWHC9NO8uJt-kx5uHIYiQdQ/viewform?usp=header) and I'll get back to you.
