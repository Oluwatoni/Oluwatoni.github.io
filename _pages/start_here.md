Hi! I'm Toni, short for [Oluwatoni](https://youtu.be/roa7i_KPFdY?t=5). I design and build software for robotic systems to solve real problems. I focus on robot perception, localization and mapping. If you're tackling something interesting in this space, [reach out](mailto:oluwatoni@oogunma.de). I'd love to hear about it.

I work as a Senior Software Engineer on the perception team at [Berkshire Grey](https://www.berkshiregrey.com/) combing out hairy problems. Prior to this, I'v had stints at [Nuro](www.nuro.ai), [Waymo](www.waymo.com), [Clearpath Robotics](https://ottomotors.com/), Nest Labs(Google Hardware) and a few other firms. There's more information about my professional experience on my [about me](/about/) page.

In my spare time, I [blog](/blog/) about what I'm learning and building. 

If you're getting started in robotics career and would like some project feedback or career advice, reach out using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfjO_PzATLdNbKujqF6jU-rk7kgWHC9NO8uJt-kx5uHIYiQdQ/viewform?usp=header) and I'll try to help.
