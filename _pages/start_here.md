Hi! I'm Toni, short for [Oluwatoni](https://youtu.be/roa7i_KPFdY?t=5). I build robotic systems to solve real problems. My expertise lies in robot perception, localization, mapping and embedded software. If you're tackling something interesting in this space, [reach out!](mailto:oluwatoni@oogunma.de) I'd love to hear about it.

I work as a Senior Software Engineer on the perception team at [Berkshire Grey](https://www.berkshiregrey.com/). Prior to this, I've had stints at [Nuro](https://www.nuro.ai/), [Waymo](https://www.waymo.com), [Clearpath Robotics](https://ottomotors.com/), Nest Labs(Google Hardware) and a few other firms. You can find more detailed information on my [about me](/about/) page.

In my spare time, I [blog](/blog/) about what I'm learning and building.

If you're getting started in robotics and would like some side-project feedback or career advice, reach out using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfjO_PzATLdNbKujqF6jU-rk7kgWHC9NO8uJt-kx5uHIYiQdQ/viewform?usp=header) and I'll try to help.
