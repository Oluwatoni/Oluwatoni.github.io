I’m Toni, short for <a href="https://youtu.be/roa7i_KPFdY?t=5" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Oluwatoni</a>. I design and build software for robotic systems that solve customer problems. I focus primarily on robotic perception but I’ve worked on localization, mapping and controls in the past. I’m currently a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.berkshiregrey.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Berkshire Grey</a> working on perception problems in the logistics and retail space.</p> <p>Previously, I worked at two start-ups in the self-driving vehicles industry: <a href="https://aerovect.com/#/home" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Aerovect</a> and <a href="https://www.nuro.ai/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nuro</a>. At AeroVect I designed and built the detection and tracking systems for vehicles and pedestrians at airports. At Nuro, I led the work on <a href="https://medium.com/nuro/safety-nuro-our-vehicles-f3c33d605614#:~:text=Emergency%20vehicle%20microphone,safely%20pull%20over." rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">siren detection and localization</a> for emergency vehicles. Before that, I was in the industrial automation space building localization, <a href="https://communitech.ca/technews/clearpath-maps-a-new-way-forward.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">mapping</a> and calibration software at Clearpath Robotics, pre-acquisition.</p> <p>While working full-time, I completed a computer science masters degree from Georgia Tech specializing in Machine learning. My undergraduate degree is in Mechatronics Engineering from the University of Waterloo where I interned at Google, Waymo and worked under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/embedded-software-group/people-profiles/sebastian-fischmeister" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Sebastian Fischmeister</a> on a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/embedded-software-group/projects/adas-treadmill-demonstrator#:~:text=The%20ADAS%20platform%20consists%20of,treadmill%20without%20it%20drifting%20away." rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">demonstrator for ADAS software</a>.</p> <p>In my spare time I <a href="/blog/">blog</a> about what I’m learning and building. Currently I’m building an audio guestbook with my friend Seyitan called RingRing.</p> <p>If you’re a student or someone early in their robotics career and you’d like a resume review, a code review or career advice reach out using <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfjO_PzATLdNbKujqF6jU-rk7kgWHC9NO8uJt-kx5uHIYiQdQ/viewform?usp=header" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this form</a> and I’ll get back to you.</p> </body></html>
